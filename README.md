# 🚀 Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification 🎯  

This project implements a **binary classification model** using **Logistic Regression** to determine whether sonar signals reflect from **rocks (🪨)** or **mines (💣)**.  
The dataset used is from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** with **208 samples** and **60 features**.  
The pipeline includes preprocessing, stratified train-test split, model training, evaluation, and a live prediction interface.

## ⚡ Features
✅ End-to-end ML pipeline (data → model → prediction)  
✅ Stratified train-test split to handle class balance  
✅ Real-time predictive system for new data  
✅ Achieved **84% training accuracy** and **76% test accuracy**

## 🛠️ Setup, Usage & Deployment
### 🔹 Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sonar-rock-vs-mine.git
cd sonar-rock-vs-mine
```
### 🔹 (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 🔹 Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 🔹 Run the training script
```bash
python sonar_model.py
```
### 🔹 Make predictions with new data
```python
input_data = [0.0223, 0.0371, 0.0422, ..., 0.0084]  # 60 feature values
prediction = model.predict([input_data])
print("Object is:", "🪨 Rock" if prediction[0] == 'R' else "💣 Mine")
```

## 🌐 Deployment Options
You can deploy this model as:  
- 🔸 **Flask / FastAPI API**  
- 🔸 **Streamlit / Gradio interactive app**  
Example (Streamlit):  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
💡 *Future versions may include a hosted web demo.*
